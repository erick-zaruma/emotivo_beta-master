This is an Android application that provides a shape to our idea of helping our fellow students navigate their college journey with least stress and more fun. We are a team of amazing people who are guided by our joint mission to achieve this goal.

Updates as on November 02, 2019:

1. We have updated the 'master' branch with all the changes from the 'branch1' and also fixed some broken code. So before working on anything, just create a new branch from master and work on it.

2. Also, it would be better if you can checkout new branch as feature/<whatever_module_you_are_working_on> from the master branch. For e.g if I want to work on 'Sun' module, I would start as: git checkout -b feature/sun_module. If some person branchs from this feature then please append  _yourname to it i.e feature/sun_module_manish. Then later merge into original feature branch so that when I merge all the feature branch to master later on, I won't have to worry about which branch is latest.
